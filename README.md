# SF4 Netplay Launcher

> **Unofficial experimental port** - **not** the official [sf4e](https://codeberg.org/adanducci/sf4e) project by **[Anthony Danducci](https://codeberg.org/adanducci/sf4e)**. Anthony Danducci does not maintain, endorse, or support this build. This is **not production-ready software** - a friends-only experiment built on upstream sf4e (MIT). See [ATTRIBUTION.md](ATTRIBUTION.md) and [docs/SCOPE_AND_LIMITATIONS.md](docs/SCOPE_AND_LIMITATIONS.md).

**SF4 Netplay Launcher** is a **third-party, experimental unofficial port** for _Ultra Street Fighter IV_ on Steam. It adds a native **Qt Host / Join / Offline** launcher and **VPS relay room codes** (`SF4-XXXX`) on top of sf4e's rollback netplay. Netplay may fail, desync, or break between releases - use only with people who accept that risk.

**Latest release:** [v0.4.1](https://github.com/Confetti3/SF4-Netplay-Launcher/releases/tag/v0.4.1) (netplay stability + connectivity improvements)

**Download:** [GitHub Releases — Latest](https://github.com/Confetti3/SF4-Netplay-Launcher/releases/latest) — asset `sf4-netplay-launcher-*-v0.4.1.zip` (not "Source code" only).

## How it works

Simple mode (default) uses a **shared VPS** so the host does not port-forward. Each player runs the same release zip. The launcher handles room codes over **HTTPS**; game rollback traffic uses **UDP/TCP** relay ports on the VPS (not TLS - that is normal for real-time netplay).

### End-to-end flow (Simple mode)

  GH <-->|rollback UDP/TCP| RL
  GJ <-->|rollback UDP/TCP| RL
  GH -.->|udp_relay or p2p| GR
  GJ -.->|udp_relay or p2p| GR
```

**Typical session**

1. **Host** clicks Host, then **Get code** - launcher calls the broker over HTTPS and receives `SF4-XXXX`, a session relay port, and (when VPS transport is `auto`) a GGPO UDP relay port.
2. **Joiner** pastes the code - launcher resolves it on the broker (HTTPS).
3. Both click **Start game** - launcher fetches a **connect-plan**, runs a **NAT probe** (`8790/udp`), registers each player's GGPO endpoint, and injects `Sidecar.dll` with `NetplayConfig` (room token, relay host/ports, transport hint).
4. **Sidecar** picks the best path: **p2p** (same public IP or punchable NAT), else **udp_relay** (direct GGPO via VPS), else **legacy_session_tunnel** (GGPO inside the GNS session relay). Legacy always works as fallback.
5. In-game lobby: Ready, character select, fight.

### What runs where

  end

  L -->|HTTPS connect-plan| B
  L -->|NAT probe| NAT
  S -->|preferred path| GGPO
  S -->|fallback tunnel| GNS
```

| Layer | Protocol | Purpose |
|-------|----------|---------|
| Room create/join, connect-plan | **HTTPS** (443) | Room codes, secrets, match metadata |
| GGPO UDP relay (preferred) | **UDP** (24456+) | Direct GGPO when broker transport is `auto` |
| Session relay (fallback) | **UDP+TCP** (23456+) | Rollback frames via GNS tunnel |
| NAT probe | **UDP** (8790) | Public endpoint discovery for connect-plan / P2P |

Broker, relay-manager, and dashboard listen on **127.0.0.1** on the VPS; only Caddy and game ports are public. See [docs/VPS_TLS_SETUP.md](docs/VPS_TLS_SETUP.md).

### Transport modes (v0.3.6)

Production VPS uses **`BROKER_GGPO_TRANSPORT=auto`**. Each room gets a session relay plus a GGPO UDP relay. The client tries faster paths first:

```
p2p -> udp_relay -> legacy_session_tunnel (always available fallback)
```

**v0.3.6** keeps **UDP relay** across rematches in the same room (relay re-binds slots; client preserves broker endpoint after fallback). Override with `SF4E_GGPO_TRANSPORT=legacy|udp|p2p|auto` (optional). Details: [docs/TRANSPORT_REGRESSION.md](docs/TRANSPORT_REGRESSION.md).

[TOC]

## Getting started

### 1. Prerequisites

Install once on each PC:

| Requirement | Link |
|-------------|------|
| **Ultra Street Fighter IV** (Steam, app 45760) | Not included in the zip |
| **Qt 6 runtime** (included in release zip) | `Qt6Core/Gui/Widgets.dll` + `plugins/` — no separate install |
| [VC++ Redistributable (x86)](https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x86.exe) | Required for sf4e binaries |

### 2. Install

1. Download the latest **team zip** from [Releases](https://github.com/Confetti3/SF4-Netplay-Launcher/releases/latest).
2. Extract the **entire** zip to one folder (e.g. `C:\Games\SF4-Netplay-Launcher\`). Keep all files together - do not copy only `Launcher.exe`.
3. Optional: run `preflight.cmd` to verify the package.
4. Double-click **`Launcher.exe`**.

Both players must use the **same release zip** (`Sidecar.dll` must match). The launcher header shows your installed version (e.g. `v0.4.1`). Use **Check for updates** on the home screen to upgrade.

### 3. Play online (Simple mode - experimental)

The launcher defaults to **Simple mode**. This path is **experimental** - it has worked in small tests but is not guaranteed. No router setup on the host PC when the VPS relay path works.

| Step | Host | Joiner |
|------|------|--------|
| 1 | Click **Host** -> **Get code** | Wait |
| 2 | Copy the **`SF4-XXXX`** code shown on screen | Click **Join** -> paste that exact code |
| 3 | Click **Start game** | Wait until host is in-game, then **Start game** |
| 4 | Press **Ready** in the in-game lobby | Press **Ready** |
| 5 | Pick characters and fight | Same |

**Tips**

- Share the **current** room code from the host screen - old codes point at empty or expired sessions.
- Stay in **Simple mode** for testing with friends. **Find match** and **Open rooms** (Advanced only) are more experimental still.
- If USF4 is not detected automatically, set `STEAM_APP_PATH` to your `Super Street Fighter IV - Arcade Edition` folder before launching.

### 4. Advanced mode (Direct IP)

Switch to **Advanced** in the launcher for classic host/join with `IP:port`, local relay, or UPnP. The host must **port-forward TCP+UDP** on the session port (default **23456**). See [docs/USER_NETPLAY.md](docs/USER_NETPLAY.md).

Direct IP behavior is unchanged from v0.2.6 - use Advanced when you prefer port-forward over VPS room codes.

## Scope and limitations

This is an **experimental unofficial port** for a **small friends group** - not official sf4e, not a public matchmaking service, and **not presented as finished or production-ready software**.

| In scope | Out of scope / limits |
|----------|------------------------|
| USF4 on **Steam**, **Windows 10+** | Game not included; no console/macOS native build |
| **Simple mode**: VPS room codes (`SF4-XXXX`), no host port forward | **~20 rooms** on default broker; rooms expire after **~15 min** idle |
| **Advanced mode**: Direct IP / UPnP / custom broker | Direct IP host must **port-forward** TCP+UDP (default **23456**) |
| Same **release zip** on all players | **Find match** / **Open rooms** are **experimental** |
| Unofficial launcher + packaging on upstream sf4e (MIT) | **Not** maintained or endorsed by Anthony Danducci |

**Less tested:** disconnect recovery, spectator mode, Linux/Proton. **Rematch** in the same VPS room is supported in v0.3.6+ (UDP relay re-registration).

Default broker: `https://74-208-200-95.nip.io` (HTTPS via Caddy; no host port forward in Simple mode).

## For developers

This repository builds **SF4 Netplay Launcher** - an **unofficial port** of upstream [sf4e](https://codeberg.org/adanducci/sf4e) by Anthony Danducci (MIT). The launcher, broker tooling, and packaging are maintained here; Anthony Danducci maintains official sf4e on Codeberg.

**Publish a release:**

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -File scripts/release-team-build.ps1 -VersionLabel 0.3.6
gh release create v0.3.8 dist/sf4-netplay-launcher-*-0.3.8.zip --title "SF4 Netplay Launcher v0.3.8" --notes-file docs/RELEASE_NOTES_v0.3.8.md
```

See [docs/RELEASE.md](docs/RELEASE.md).

### Supported environments

* Windows: Windows 10 or later
* Linux: Fedora 40+, Steam Deck (via Proton)

### Running on Windows

Windows users with a working Steam installation can run the launcher by extracting a release zip and double-clicking `Launcher.exe`. The launcher attempts to detect your SF4 installation automatically. Windows users with uncommon or damaged Steam installations may set the `STEAM_APP_PATH` environment variable to the absolute path of the `Super Street Fighter IV - Arcade Edition` directory installed by Steam. You can navigate to this directory using the Steam library's context menu by right-clicking on Ultra Street Fighter IV's library entry, hovering over "Manage", then selecting "Browse local files", as shown below.

![The Steam right-click context menu, opened on the Ultra Street Fighter 4 library list entry](images/browse-local-files-context-menu.png)

### Running on Linux

The most straightforward way to launch on Linux is with [protontricks](https://github.com/Matoking/protontricks). Extract the release, then run `protontricks-launch Launcher.exe` and select SF4 from the popup UI. For convenience, `protontricks-launch --appid 45760 Launcher.exe` can be used to launch non-interactively, e.g. from shell scripts or program shortcuts.

Linux users who do not install `protontricks` may set the `STEAM_APP_PATH` environment variable to the path of the `Super Street Fighter IV - Arcade Edition` directory installed by Steam, as demonstrated above. Users should take care to ensure the variable points to a Windows-formatted path accessible from within the Proton container for SF4, and it may be helpful to take advantage of Wine providing the Linux system root as the `Z:` root inside Wine to specify the path. For example, if the local directory is available at `/home/steamdeck/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/common/Super Street Fighter IV - Arcade Edition`, the corresponding path through the Proton container would be `Z:\\home\\steamdeck\\.local\\share\\Steam\\steamapps\\common\\Super Street Fighter IV - Arcade Edition`.

## Building

The codebase inherits from upstream **sf4e** and is built primarily with [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/)
2019 16.10 or later with Visual C++. Other development environments will need
support for installing dependencies, ideally via [vcpkg](https://vcpkg.io/en/index.html)
and build file generation via [CMake](https://cmake.org/).

To build with VS2019 16.10+:

1. Follow steps 1 and 2 in [`vcpkg`'s Getting Started guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/vcpkg/get_started/get-started),
   stopping after `vcpkg` has been bootstrapped.
   - You can stop at step 3 - this repo already has a manifest file.
2. Set up a local `CMakeUserPresets.json` to describe your environment.
   The following can be used as a quickstart, making sure to provide the
   path to the copy of `vcpkg` checked out in step 1: 
```
{
    "version": 2,
    "configurePresets": [
      {
        "name": "default",
        "inherits": "x86-msvc-ninja-relwithdebinfo",
        "environment": {
          "VCPKG_ROOT": "C:/Users/myuser/path/to/vcpkg"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
  
```
   - Since SF4 is a 32-bit executable, binaries and dependencies
     (most importantly Detours) also need to be built targeting a
     32-bit host to properly hook SF4's instructions.
3. Open `CMakeLists.txt` with VS2019's native CMake integration.
   - Ensure [CMakePresets.json integration in Visual Studio](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/cmake-presets-vs?view=msvc-170#enable-cmakepresets-json-integration) is enabled.
4. Run `Build All`. Confirm that `Launcher.exe` and `Sidecar.dll` are in
   the build output.
5. Run `Launcher.exe`.

To build with the CMake command line:

1. Set up `vcpkg`, as above in step 1.
2. Set up a local `CMakeUserPresets.json` to describe your environment,
   as above in step 2.
3. Using a CLI environment with CMake and a compiler prepared, run
   `cmake --preset default` from the root of the repository.
   - VS users may wish to use either the x86 Native Tools or the
     x64_x86 Cross Tools developer command prompts, as they already
     provide tools like Ninja and Cmake, and have the various environment
     variables used by CMake already prepared.
4. Build by running `cmake --build ./path-to-binary-dir/` from the root
   of the repository. Confirm that `Launcher.exe` and `Sidecar.dll` are in
   the build output.
   * If a `CMakeUserPresets.json` file like the one in step 2 is used, the
     the binary dir is `./msvc-build/default`.
5. Run `Launcher.exe`.

Builds generated with CMake that cannot take advantage of `vcpkg` will need to
provide the following dependencies:

* [Detours](https://github.com/microsoft/Detours). Detours is used to install
  custom netplay hooks at runtime.
* [ValveFileVDF](https://github.com/TinyTinni/ValveFileVDF). ValveFileVDF
  is used to parse Steam's configuration files, to automatically detect
  your installation of SF4.
* [Dear Imgui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui). Dear Imgui is used to
  provide custom overlays for new features and non-durable,
  development-time debugging.
* [spdlog](https://github.com/gabime/spdlog). `spdlog` is used to provide
  durable file logging, both at development time and in release builds.
* [nlohmann/json](https://github.com/nlohmann/json). `json` is used for
  message serialization.
* [GameNetworkingSockets](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/GameNetworkingSockets/).
  `GamenNetworkingSockets` provides a very helpful high-level API on top
  of message passing, and additionally supports NAT hole punching if
  a signalling server is run.
* [GGPO](https://github.com/pond3r/ggpo), used to provide rollback.
