# SF4 Enhanced — beta tester guide

Thank you for testing VPS rollback netplay. Follow these steps so sessions work reliably.

## Before you play

1. Download the latest team zip from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/Confetti3/SF4e/releases/latest) (currently **v0.2.7.3**).
2. Extract the **entire** zip to one folder on each PC — keep `Launcher.exe`, `Sidecar.dll`, and `launcher-ui/` together.
3. Run `preflight.ps1` once per machine (optional sanity check).
4. Confirm both players show the **same version** in the launcher header (e.g. `v0.2.7.3`). Use **Check for updates** if versions differ.

## Recommended flow (Simple mode)

| Step | Host | Joiner |
|------|------|--------|
| 1 | **Host** → **Create relay room** | Wait |
| 2 | Copy the **current** `SF4-XXXX` from the host screen (not an old code) | Paste that exact code on **Join** |
| 3 | **Start game** | Wait until host shows **Connected**, then **Start game** |
| 4 | Both press **Ready** in the in-game lobby | Same |
| 5 | Play | Same |

Stay in **Simple mode** (default). Do not use **Find match** or **Open rooms** unless asked — those features are experimental.

## If something goes wrong

| Problem | What to check |
|---------|----------------|
| Empty lobby / wrong opponent | Host and joiner must use the **same** `SF4-XXXX` from the host's **current** screen |
| Version mismatch in-game | Reinstall the same zip on both PCs |
| Black screen after portraits | Update to **v0.2.7.3** or newer on **both** PCs |
| Join blocked before game starts | Host must click **Start game** first |

## Reporting bugs

Include:

- Version from launcher header or `BUILD_INFO.txt` (**Git** line)
- `%APPDATA%\sf4e\logs\sf4e.log` from **both** players (if possible)
- Screenshot of launcher or in-game overlay
- Steps: Host or Join, room code used, when it failed

Send logs from: `%APPDATA%\sf4e\logs\sf4e.log`
