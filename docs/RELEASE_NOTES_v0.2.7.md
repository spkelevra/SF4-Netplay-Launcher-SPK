# SF4 Enhanced v0.2.7

Relay-first rollback netplay for **Ultra Street Fighter IV** (Steam) with a modern **SF4 Enhanced** launcher.

## What's new in v0.2.7

- **VPS-hosted relay:** game traffic runs on the broker VPS (`74.208.200.95`) — host and joiner connect outbound; no host router port-forward or `RelayHost.exe` for casual relay
- **Broker `forceVpsRelay`:** room codes resolve to the VPS; session relay starts per room with matching `Sidecar.dll` hash
- **Join preflight:** clearer errors when the VPS relay is unreachable (not “forward on host router”)
- **Direct IP unchanged:** Advanced → Direct IP still uses host public IP + session port as in v0.2.6

Also includes v0.2.6: direct IP fix, in-app updater download/apply fix.
