# SF4 Enhanced v0.2.1

Rollback netplay for **Ultra Street Fighter IV** (Steam) with launcher-driven Host / Join / Offline.

## What's new

- **Controller fix:** launcher auto-netplay now waits for **Start or LK** pad capture before starting a session (matches upstream sf4e behavior; fixes keyboard-default / sporadic controller input)
- **Rematch:** after a match ends, lobby ready state resets automatically — both players press **Ready** again to run back without reconnecting (character/stage selections preserved)
- **Direct IP default:** Advanced mode and **Direct IP** are now the default connection method (relay room codes still available in the connection dropdown or Simple mode)

## Based on sf4e

Fork of [sf4e](https://codeberg.org/adanducci/sf4e) (MIT). See `ATTRIBUTION.md` in the zip.

## Quick start (direct IP — default)

| Host | Joiner |
