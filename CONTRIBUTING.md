# How to contribute

> **SF4 Netplay Launcher** is an **experimental unofficial port** — not production-ready software. Bug reports help improve a friends-only test build; do not present this project as stable or "working" netplay for general use.

## Developers: local git ignores

The public GitHub repo does not include a root `.gitignore`. After cloning, copy the template so build output and local secrets stay untracked:

```powershell
copy contrib\developer-gitignore .gitignore
```

## Testers and players: Submitting bugs

**Please do**:
* Submit issues when you find a bug! The issue template
  has a good checklist of things to include when submitting an issue. Issue
  reports without a complete description may be rejected outright.
* Include video evidence when sending issues! Video is extremely helpful
  for both describing and reproducing issues. If you have the computing
  resources to spare, you may want to consider recording tests with
  [OBS](https://github.com/obsproject/obs-studio) or another screen-recording
  solution.

**Please do not**:
* Submit feature requests. As players, we already have a lot of features in mind-
  to the point where we could work on this project as if it was a full time job.
